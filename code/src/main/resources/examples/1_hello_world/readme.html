<b>What example does:</b> Just a basic Hello World Sample. <br/>
<ul>
<li>
It reads in the Excel file, causes a rule to fire against the first cell, 
changing it to 'HelloWorld'.
</li><li>The output is to a different file, so we don't overwrite any Excel files.
The sample also only operates on Cells that are named Ranges within the spreadsheet.
</li>
</ul>
