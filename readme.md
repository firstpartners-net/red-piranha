## More powerful Excel, Word and Office Documents using Business Rules

Excel is great for collecting data. But once things get more complicated, you may be asking "what next"?

* Your Excel calculations are good. Maybe too good - now you can't follow what is going on. Wouldn't something a little bit clearer be better?
* Are you sharing your spreadsheets? What if somebody changes a formula without you noticing?
* Your business absolutely needs to be sure the rules are being applied - and you need a way of checking what those rules are later.

Powered by [RedHat Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools), Red-Piranha allows you to state your Excel business rules in a simple **when ... then** format that everybody can understand.  It acts as a bridge between Excel / Microsoft Office and Business Rules and workflow Engine (including AI and Planner) from Red Hat.

* _Spreadsheet + Business Rules = Result_

Instead of having your knowledge 'disappear' into complicated formulas that you can't read, a Rules Engine keeps things in a simple 'English' like format. Even better, because of the way it works 'under the covers' it is faster and more powerful than code translated into a technical language.

## What is a Business Rule

A business rule is a simple statement that represents some important aspect of a business. By capturing the rules for your business--the logic that governs its operation-- you gain the ability to create systems fully aligned with your business needs.

All people have business rules. Examples of a 'real' busniess rules that can be fed into the engine are:

* `When the market rises by more than 25%, Then sell the stock`
* `When the total is less than â‚¬100 And the claimant is low risk Then transfer the funds` `

Because business rules can be written in 'near English' language they are much more meaningful to non-technical domain experts. In this format, the knowledge they contain is easier to manage, maintain and share. They also carry the advantage of separating the meaning of the business from the actual technical implementation.

## 3 Minute Quickstart

We have snapshotted the [code that the book was written on here](https://github.com/paulbrowne-irl/red-piranha/tree/v0.9). You probably don't want this, the libraries this code is based on are now deprecated. The code in this site is much more up to date.
