## Business Rules ##

A business rule is a compact and simple statement that represents some important aspect of a business. By capturing the rules for your business--the logic that governs its operation-- you gain the ability to create systems fully aligned with your
business needs.

All people have business rules â€“ except that they might not them of them as such.
Examples of rules are 'if the market rises by more than 25%, then sell the stock', 'payout the claim if it is less than Eur100' or similar statements the fit your particular domain.

While the use of well understood algorithms such as Rete and Leaps can make
systems that use Business Rules both simple and run quickly, we are interested
primarily in the financial knowledge management possibilities afforded to us by Rule
engines.

Because business rules can be written in 'near English' language, not hidden in code,
they are much more meaningful to non-technical domain experts. In this format, the
knowledge they contain is easier to manage, maintain and share. They also carry the
advantage of separating the meaning of the business from the actual technical
implementation.
