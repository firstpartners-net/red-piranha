Next :
Work through what is going on with rules output to Excel
Write junit test to mimic (or find existing)


UNDERSTAND
Understand different objects
add listeners / explore more
add logging around KIE
WorkingMemoryEventListener ->  RuleRuntimeEventListener for new cells - wokring?


Later (move)
* split out compile steps


Now pushing 
* Tidy

** Config updates when rules pushed
** rules Steps
** most info through to front end
** more tests compile / rule
*** Testing: 55 tests, 2 Errors, 2 failures
* skeleton Doc (Dev, User)

* look at moving over private samples
* look at integration test examples (either via Srping MVC or other)


Think Design
* Robust simple
* as much rest as possible
* integration and pre/post release tests (e.g. Selenumum)



TODO MOVE
	* Read drools doc in more detail
	* Notes on getting started with build
	* Update to latest KIE version
		* Running again
	* Excel ??
    * Rules calling
        * Internal
        * Post to KIE Server / get from KIE server
	* Comments on build
	* tIDY
		* Look for TODO comments in code
		* Update Javadoc
	* NTH
		* Add Docker image (based on main java one)
		* Integrate in EI sample
		* Add Spring MVC Tests
		* Review update dependencie
	* Spring
		* Enable swagger
		* Enable more services
	* Maven site - document rp code?



	NEXT: 
	• Compile
	• Test constructor
	• Rest service / js front end



RP next todo from:

	• Working excel example
		○ Spring boot showing logs
		○ Unit tests 
		○ Note (my draft)
