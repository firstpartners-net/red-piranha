# Red Piranha #
### More powerful Excel, Google Docs and Spreadsheets using JBoss Rules and Google App Engine ###

Powered by [Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools), Red-Piranha allows you to state your Excel business rules in a simple **when ... then** format that everybody can understand.<br />
Instead of having your knowledge 'disappear' into complicated formulas that you can't read, Drools keeps things in a simple 'English' like format.<br />
Even better, because of the way it works 'under the covers' it is faster and more powerful than code translated into a technical language.

Excel is great for collecting data. But once things get more complicated, are your spreadsheets missing something?

  * Your excel calculations are good. Maybe too good - now you can't follow what is going on. Wouldn't something a little bit clearer be better?
  * Are you sharing your spreadsheets? What if somebody changes a formula without you noticing?
  * Are you looking for a better way to share and publish your knowledge?
  * Do you need more power to extend what Excel or Google Spreadsheets already provide?

Even better, it's all open source and free to get started. And it works with Google Spreadsheet as well as Excel.
