# Red Piranha Examples

General Statement on what Red Piranha does

This section shows you how to apply Business Rules to your spreadsheets.

  * Spreadsheet + Business Rules = Result

Why would we want to do this?

  * **Excel Formulas** can get too complicated. Rules are more simple.
  * Same for **Excel Macros** - and they have security concerns. You can tightly control the rules.
  * Google Spreadsheets are like Excel online, but don't have all the power. Rules add them back.
  * You control the rules. Who changes the Excel file when you're not looking?
