# Todo List

Yes, we should be using the GitHub issue tracker. But for this stage in development (multiple small improvements) a todo list works fine.

# NEXT STEP 
*
* Run and working preprocessor test
    * Stengthen unit test
    * Pullback exact info and test for it

* SheetNames and Test
    * outline class
        * table
    * outline unit tests
    * update doc-script-support.md
    
* Groovy Script update
    * Update script to use new calass

* Update documentation (go through again)
    * In example 4 
    * In script comments
    * In Javadoc
        * What is is
        * Name of Class
        * See scripts in exampleds

* Update script to set headings 
    * Helper Script - set block?
    * Unit test on helper script

* Output to CSV
    * output as 2 or three columns

* test through
* update documentation sample 4

Generate 2nd File into 5th sample folder (for multiplel filtes test)
    * copy generate spreasheet


## Refresh knowledge and tidy
* Snapshot current code and make note for book readers
* dsl based on existing - working and sharable
* Read all docs and refresh
* Add note on book to here
* Resolve GitHub [firstpartners-net/red-piranha] pages build and deployment workflow run 
* Tests passing

## TODO Next Sprint

** Read all files in folder
** Output
* Docs
** Tidy current docs - next pass
* Future
** Create Fiancial extraction Sample - analsyis of single case
** multiple output options
* decision test
* Release
** Automate release (package and docker)
** Or at least update release notes

## Tidy
* Clear down warnings
* Figure out why current excel example is outputting incorrectly
* More info through to front end
* more tests compile / rule
* tidy of all readme pages
* view vulneribilty report (right click top right of tabs and renable)

## TODO on Deployment
* Can deploy and work against true docs

## Confirm delivered on previous sprint

Platform (with specific examples)

* Good draft of user and dev documentation.
* (Y) Can hand to Java developer and build - proper release
* (Y) Could be run by simple end-user with docker - proper release

## refactor
* (Move RuleRunner.java remove RuleBuilder to same pre-built model that 
* DecisionModel uses)
* Simplify down to Cells (remove all notion or ranges?)
* restore commented out tests (put @Test back on them)
** testJSONInOut

## Upgrades
* Migrate to latest version of all libs

## later - tidy off these
* recover and reused previous examples (to web) - currently in test folder
* understand model back and forward better
* conversion to-from excel - make sure it works better, json better?
* Dive through stack - can bring back any more info to user
* Tidy Bootstrap on page
* final tests running
* RP using model from business central or simliar exported backage
* Move bootstrap offline (and other javascript to make more robust)
* tidy DSL example
* Serialsiation - Into Tests of convertor / Java test data in JSON
* use to trest cell conversion
* samples - url to view input, out and rule files (or note how to do this)
* do interim github and docker release
* Better display of Java objects
* Read drools doc in more detail
* Outline how to integrate with KIE Server
* Review / tidy Javadoc
* Maven site - document rp code?
* Update red-piranha-sourceforge.com to point to github (grab info first)
* Enable Swagger
* Turn back on Spring Services in applicaiton.properites
* Understand Github pages, Jekyll and see if can build an even 'friendlier' version of this site.
