# Todo List

Yes, we should be using the GitHub issue tracker. But for this stage in development (multiple small improvements) a todo list works fine.


### Design

Key design principles

* Robust simple
* As much Established frameowrks as possible
* integration and pre/post release tests (e.g. Selenumum)
* Examples easy to use

## To understand

* Understand different kie objects
* add logging around KIE (to file, but also debug listener)
* WorkingMemoryEventListener ->  RuleRuntimeEventListener for new cells - wokring?
* Understand bootstrap and different layout options

## Todo Book Samples

* NEXT !!!
* What book sample (to be integrated into standard deploy)
* what features needed for book examples - Possible
    * Extract Named ranges from Excel
    * Choice of colours to update (?)

## Next

* Example for simple hellow world
  * 1st sample to "Hello world"

* LATER
  * understand model back and forward better
  * trigger exception, make sure it displays ok
  * tidy of readme x2
  * conversion to-from excel - make sure it works better, json better?
  * Dive through stack - can bring back any more info to user
  * Tidy Bootstrap on page
  * tests running
  * RP using model from business central
  * Move bootstrap offline (and other javascript to make more robust)
  * tidy DSL example
  * show hide sample
  * Serialsiation - Into Tests of convertor / Java test data in JSONu
  * use to trest cell conversion
  * samples - url to view input, out and rule files
  * do interim github and docker release

## Aim of Next Sprint

Platform (with existing examples) and good draft of user and dev documentation.

* Can hand to Java developer and build
* Could be run by simple end-user
    * (e.g. (with Docker or Native) - )

    


## Todo Next 
* Figure out why current excel example is outputting incorrectly
* More info through to front end
* more tests compile / rule - currently 
* look at moving over private samples
* Understand Github pages, Jekyll and see if can build an even 'friendlier' version of this site.
* (another) review and tidy of two readme pages


## Todo Soon

* Better display of Java objects
* Read drools doc in more detail
* Outline how to integrate with KIE Server
* Review / tidy Javadoc
* Add Spring MVC Tests
* Review update dependencies (in Pom.xml)


## Todo Later

* Maven site - document rp code?
* Update red-piranha-sourceforge.com to point to github (grab info first)
* Enable Swagger
* Turn back on Spring Services in applicaiton.properites
