<b>Notes:</b> Just a basic Hello World Sample. It reads in the Excel file, causes a rule to fire against the first cell, 
changing it to 'HelloWorld'. The outputfile is different, we don't overwrite any Excel files.
The sample also only operates on Cells that are named Ranges within the spreadsheet.
