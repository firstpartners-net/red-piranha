Bonus Chapter 	The above 12 chapters are a complete book, aimed at the Business user, with a full solution that they can run on their own PC
 
The bonus chapter shows how to evolve the tool into a full Enterprise solution – reassuring them that they are on “the right track” with the Business rules based approach. 
 
Since this bonus chapters can be more code based, it makes the rest of the book cleaner (e.g. here’s a graphical way of doing it – if you want to dive deeper look at the Bonus chapter …)
 
Based on an existing GitHub repository, this chapter gives a Java developer with knowledge of standard tools (e.g. Maven, Spring) a worked starter example that they can quickly expand into a fully deployable Enterprise Web Project customized to specific business needs.
 
To repeat – this is *not* needed for Business Users to give full value out of the book, but readers do want a clear roadmap to build on what they have learned.	•	P2
