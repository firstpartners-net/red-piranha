<I>Sample Under Development.</I><br/>
<b>Notes:</b> Read information from a complex Excel Spreadsheet and summarize as json/csv.
<p></p>
The sample demonstrates preprocessing to add Named ranges to an Excel file -
 often needed for historical documents and used to identify the Cells we want to extact and pass into the Rule Engine. 
</p><p>
The sample directory contains a prepropssing script called <I>InjectNamedRange.Groovy</I>. There is a setting in
<i>application.properties</i> that causes files with this name to be excecuted after the Spreadsheet is loaded but 
before the business rules are executed.  
</p><p>
This script is passed a copy of the incoming spreadsheet which allows it to be manipulated. In this cases the 
script adds Excel Named Ranges tagging the areas of the sheet we are most interested in.
