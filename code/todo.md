# Todo List

Yes, we should be using the GitHub issue tracker. But for this stage in development (muliple small improvements) a todo list works fine

## Next Step

* Tidy docs - todo.md / readme-dev.md / readme.md
* merge structure back into branch

## Aim of Next Sprint

Platform (with existing examples) and good draft of user and dev documentation.

* Can hand to Java developer and build
* (with Docker, examples and site) - could be run be end-user and have idea what talking about

Set in place key design principles

* Robust simple
* As much est as possible
* integration and pre/post release tests (e.g. Selenumum)
* Examples easy to use

## To understand

Understand different kie objects
add listeners / explore more
add logging around KIE
WorkingMemoryEventListener ->  RuleRuntimeEventListener for new cells - wokring?

## Later (move)

- [*] Config updates when rules pushed
- [ ]  rules Steps
- [ ]  most info through to front end
- [ ]  more tests compile / rule - currently 
- [ ]   Tests compiling Testing: 55 tests, 2 Errors, 2 failures

* look at moving over private samples
* look at integration test examples (either via Srping MVC or other)
* split out compile steps

## Todo Soon
