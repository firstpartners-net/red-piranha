Red-Piranha is a set of Power tools for Excel and Office Power users.</p>
<p> It packages <a href="https://www.drools.org/">the Drools Business Rules Management System (BRMS) solution from RedHat (IBM)</a>
to be more accessible to Windows Desktop users. In particular, it makes it easier to feed information from Excel and Word (Office) Documents, apply business rules to these documents, and get useful results.</p>
<p>Most importantly, because your business rules are in an 'English like' language, it makes it very easy for you (and colleagues) to see what checks are being made.
