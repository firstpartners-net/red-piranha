# Todo List

Yes, we should be using the GitHub issue tracker. But for this stage in development (multiple small improvements) a todo list works fine.

## NEXT Book Samples

* Example for simple hellow world
  * 1st sample to "Hello world"
  * look at moving over private samples as basis for book

## Remember

Platform (with specific examples)

* Good draft of user and dev documentation.
* Can hand to Java developer and build
* Could be run by simple end-user
  * (e.g. (with Docker or Native) - )
* Tests automoated

## Examples

* First examples rules

* 02-example-HelloWorld.md - Most simple possible
* 03-example-write-first-rule.md


### examples build test chapter 4-6

04-example-rule-main-features.md
05-example-testing.md
06-example-rule-other-features.md

## examples workflow forms chapter 7 and 8
07-example-workflow.md
08-example-forms.md



## examples decision tables and text based

09-example-decision-table.md
09-example-dsl.md
12-example-text-based-rules.md
?? any other - RPify existing drools sample



## Example deploy notes Azure
10-example-azure.md

* Azure (Plan B?)
* Possible use of App Service



## Walk through extending - Bonus Chapter
Current Tech Example needed


    

## later


* Tidy Later
  * understand model back and forward better
  * trigger exception, make sure it displays ok
  * tidy of readme x2
  * conversion to-from excel - make sure it works better, json better?
  * Dive through stack - can bring back any more info to user
  * Tidy Bootstrap on page
  * tests running
  * RP using model from business central
  * Move bootstrap offline (and other javascript to make more robust)
  * tidy DSL example
  * show hide sample
  * Serialsiation - Into Tests of convertor / Java test data in JSONu
  * use to trest cell conversion
  * samples - url to view input, out and rule files
    * or note how to do this
  * do interim github and docker release
  * Better display of Java objects
  * Read drools doc in more detail
  * Outline how to integrate with KIE Server
  * Review / tidy Javadoc
  * Add Spring MVC Tests
  * Review update dependencies (in Pom.xml)

* what features needed for book examples - Possible
  * Extract Named ranges from Excel
  * Choice of colours to update (?)

## Todo Next 

* Figure out why current excel example is outputting incorrectly
* More info through to front end
* more tests compile / rule - currently 

* Understand Github pages, Jekyll and see if can build an even 'friendlier' version of this site.
* (another) review and tidy of two readme pages





## Todo Later

* Maven site - document rp code?
* Update red-piranha-sourceforge.com to point to github (grab info first)
* Enable Swagger
* Turn back on Spring Services in applicaiton.properites



TIDY THESE

NEED FOM RP
	• Aim Book: Intro to Rules, link to other relevant tech (me), onboarding to project
	• Aim RP Robust, easily deployable app (e.g. Docker image, link to online Jboss tools / images) allowing excel user to run rules
	•  Examples and docs to support this 
		○ Next steps in /code/todo.md - Examples to form basis for this
		○ Link to Sandbox / Business Central image provided by JBoss
	
TODO BOOK
	
	• NEXT : 
	• Read Docs - understand features and examples, esp busienss centraal that I can leverage 
		○ Drools
		○ Kogito
		○ JPBM
		○ Business Central
			§ Deploy to remote servers
		○ Github
			§ https://github.com/kiegroup/
		○ Spring Boot / Docker / Native
		○ Maven
		○ Other close tabs
		
	• Make notes against Kie sandbox
		○ https://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com/
			§ https://sandbox.kie.org/#/7249f3bf-3a51-4eb1-930f-6d681746b2a4/file/Untitled.dmn
			§ Any other on this site?
		○ Possible OpenShift Tutorial - https://github.com/eschabell/openshift-bpmsuite-workshop
	
	• First pass through other books and vdeos
		Squizz other drools books (get from z?)
		Youtube Key: https://www.youtube.com/c/KIE-community-channel/videos
	• Poke through Business Centraal
		○ Examples
		○ Loading a new example
		○ Loading a new model
		○ Can I just post JSON?
	• Second pass through docs
		○ Map to where I explain docs in book
	• Initial investigation of tech samples needed / spec of RP needed to tie to exisitng Jboss compontnes (eg Kogito sandbox)
		○ 2nd pass Jboss Workbench  / business ctrnal and other parts needed
		○ Spec (below and todo.md) Version of RP to support examples in the book
	• Next level pass through mappings (table below)
	• Review other key points / tech I want to hit on for SSP 
		○ AI
		○ PMML
		
	• Understand 
		○ Does it help deploy
		○ Any extra features
	• Possible topics
		○ Scorecards
		○ Optaplanner
	• Landscape
		○ Azure Logic apps
		○ Other windows solutions in this areas
			§ Biztalk
			§ Powersuite
	• Red Piranha version of Drools samples
		○ Use rules to map over
	• Other Material
		○ Work through other book (to Google docs)
		○ Work though youtube video


QUESTIONS
	• What new chapter headings - Update below
	• What I have have to learn (e.g. AI, azure, ..)
	• What samples needed for each chapter
	• What RP needed to support (or how much can be done with KIE/Drools)
	• Wider tech understanding - another pass - but note for later
	• State of community and ecosystem - anything I'm missing?

HOLD BUT SOONISH
LATER
	• Review chapters (and switch around for better flow)
	• Investigate more on Biztalk
	• Position RP as example into Drools
	• Mark Proctor - forward but also tie into Red Hat / IBM
	• How tie this into learning course
	• create book2 landing page for github
	• Reachout Again  Mark Proctor (when understand community and existing roadmap)
