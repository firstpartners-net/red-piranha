## How these sample differ from the book ##

These samples are similar, but differ in several key aspects to the book samples

  1. These samples are more 'Excel Centric' i.e. they use the Red Piranha Code base to execute Rules Code (although Drools is still being called underneath)
  1. These samples are 'work in progress' and will diverge further over time.
  1. For the moment, these samples are less 'user friendly'. E.g. they use an Ant instead of a Maven build, are called using JUnit etc

## How to use the Red - Piranha Examples ##

_For the moment this page presumes that you've followed the instructions on the
[DevDeveloperGettingStarted](DevDeveloperGettingStarted.md) page._
